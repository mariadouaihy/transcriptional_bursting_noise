# Transcriptional Noise Analysis in Early *Drosophila* Embryo

This repository contains the code used in the study:

**"Mitotic reactivation and transcriptional bursting govern transcriptional noise in the early *Drosophila* embryo"**

---

## Goal

This code quantifies transcriptional noise across different phenotypes by calculating:

- **Mean**, **variance**, and **Fano Factor (FF)** of transcriptional activity
- Computed both:
  - On **sliding time windows**
  - **Per nucleus**
- Comparison of transcriptional noise between **multiple phenotypes**

---

## Folder Structure

To run the code, data for each phenotype must be stored in a standardized format:
